# JMeter Load Testing with GitHub Actions

This repository demonstrates how to use JMeter for load testing, integrated with GitHub Actions. It contains a sample JMeter test plan (`practiceLoadTest.jmx`) and a GitHub Actions workflow to automate the execution of load tests.

## Repository Structure

- **`practiceLoadTest.jmx`**: JMeter test plan that defines a sample load test to simulate traffic on a specific webpage.
- **`.github/workflows/ci.yml`**: GitHub Actions workflow file to automate the JMeter load testing process.
- **`README.md`**: Instructions for running the tests and understanding the project.

## Workflow Overview

The GitHub Actions workflow:
1. Checks out the repository.
2. Creates a `reports` directory for test results.
3. Executes the JMeter test using the `QAInsights/PerfAction` GitHub Action.
4. Generates test reports and uploads them as artifacts.

## Running the Tests

To run the workflow:
1. Commit your changes to the `main` branch or create a pull request targeting `main`.
2. Navigate to the "Actions" tab in your repository.
3. Select the **CI** workflow and click **Run workflow**.

## Reports

- The test results (`result.jtl`) and the HTML reports generated by JMeter will be available as artifacts in the workflow run. 
- You can download them from the "Artifacts" section of the GitHub Actions page.

## Sample JMeter Configuration

The `practiceLoadTest.jmx` test plan performs the following:
- Sends HTTP GET requests to [Alibaba's showroom webpage](https://www.alibaba.com/showroom/alibaba-online-shopping-website.html).
- Simulates 20 threads with a ramp-up time of 1 second.
- Executes the test once per thread.

## Requirements

- JMeter (5.6.3) (if running the tests locally).
- GitHub repository with Actions enabled.
